##1. The boardgame
<hr style="solid gray">
“Long John Silver's crew has committed mutiny and has him cornered and tied up!
Round after round, they question him about the location of his treasure and explore the island following his directions — or perhaps his misdirections? Who knows... The old sea dog is surely planning an escape, after all, after which he will definitely try to get his treasure back. Treasure Island is a game of bluffing and adventure in which one player embodies Long John, trying to mislead the others in their search for his treasure. The hunt reaches its climax with Long John's escape, when he will make a final run to get the booty for himself!!” (boardgamegeek.com)
